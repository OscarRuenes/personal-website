The game is absolutely beautiful with a hand-crafted cartoon art style, incredible sound design, and an unmatched sountrack by Hollow Knight's music composer Christopher Larkin. The game is fairly difficult with interactive combat and tricky platforming, and I am just in love with it! There are apparently 40 bosses in the game, and I cannot wait to face them since the bosses I have fought have all been a treat to figure out. Highly recommend you give this game a try!</p>

Its unique art style and charm attracted an insance amount of players, especially if you consider the small size of its indie development team, Team Cherry. I had a great time fighting the game's insane bosses and trying to clear all of them in more difficult environments through the DLC. I would definitely recommend playing Hollow Knight if you like metroidvanias or platformers, regardless of its difficulty.</p>

The gameplay is challenging at times and can be really fun. There are also a vast cast of characters, each equipped with their unique ways of attacking/moving/other creative changes to other characters. Every run is unique, and I believe this game, like Silksong, is underpriced with how much content you get. With over 20 endings and even more characters combined with insanely well written stories, this game is truly a masterpiece.</p>

								<p><a href="https://ghostoftsushima.fandom.com/wiki/Ghost_of_Tsushima" target="_blank"title="Ghost of Tsushima Wiki">Ghost of Tsushima</a> was my first open-world game and has beautiful graphics. I thoroughly enjoyed playing through the game as it has a basic, yet entertaining story (with some fun twists in the main and side stories), fun customizations for how to do combat with your character, as well as a very cool stance mechanic that you can change mid-fight to perform probably like 50+ combos on enemies. I also really liked the bow mechanics of the game and sniping down mongol enemies was very satisfying since you can one shot them stealthily with an archer build. The armormsets are also beautiful, and unlocking all of your gear, stances, hp, and so many other things made the game super fun and lasted a very long time. I highly recommend this game still if you enjoy leveling up your characters or open-world adventure games with a good story.</p>

The animation for the movie is insanely good, there are colors, camera postions/effects, sounds/songs, and probably more that convey and foreshadow the plot as well as convey hidden meanings. You could analyze this movie for years and find new ways the screeenwriters, animators, or composers used their unique additions to the movie as story elements. Aside from those insane details, the story is very good and has a very important message that I think everyone should see. 10/10 I recommend watching this movie!</p>

							<p>I joined band in sixth grade as a percussionist. As a band, we played live concerts for our communities and marching shows in high school during football games and for our own competitions. Check out a run from my first marching season or some of the percussion pieces I have been a part of! <br> 
							I met so many great people from band and grew so much as a person through my experiences with others. I learned how to stay disciplined and I owe so much to what this community has given me. While my days in band may be over, the memories I made and the changes it brought to my life will never escape me. I also plan on getting my own drumkit later in life and I can go back to drumming!</p>
